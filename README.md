# Water bodies image-segmentation

In this project I create an image segmentation model by implementing the U-Net architecture.

The data used to train the model was obtaines from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/franciscoescobar/satellite-images-of-water-bodies). 

The model achieved the following metrics.

Here you can see some examples of the masks generated by the model.
