# Image segmentation on water bodies

In this project I developed an AI model for image segmentation focused on water bodies. By implementing the U-Net architecture and applying data augmentation, the model accurately delineates water areas within images, generating precise masks that highlight the water's presence.

Here you can see some examples of the masks generated by the model.

### Technologies Used:

- **keras**: user-friendly deep learning library for building and training neural networks in Python.
- **TensorFlow**: The machine learning framework that powers the image classification model.
- **Python**: The programming language used for developing the classifier and the FastAPI application.
- **NumPy**: A library for numerical operations, essential for data manipulation in the model.

### Project Components:

1. **Dataset**: The model is trained on a dataset obtained from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/franciscoescobar/satellite-images-of-water-bodies), it contains images of 2841 water bodies with multiple shapes. all of these data went through a data augmentation process to add the images shifted vertically and horizontaly to the dataset.


2. **TensorFlow Model**: The model was created using the U-Net architecture, wich consists of an encoder and a decoder and some skip connections between them. The image below ilustrates the architecture.
